<p>This is (part 1 of) a conceptual intro to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Stream.luau</code>, a (very new) library I wrote for managing the complexity of event-driven programming in Roblox (with types!).
It is directly inspired by <a href="https://quenty.github.io/NevermoreEngine/api/Rx/">Rx (Nevermore)</a>, which itself is a port of <a href="https://rxjs.dev/">RxJS</a> to lua (also see the <a href="https://gist.github.com/Anaminus/1f31af4e5280b9333f3f58e13840c670">standalone version by Anaminus</a>). See the “IAQ” (immediately anticipated questions) section at the end for comparisons to observables and Rx. For now we will not assume prior familiarity with observables.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-stream">What is a Stream?</h2>
<p>It’s a function (there are no classes in this library - just typed-functions), which takes a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">listener: (T...) -&gt; ()</code> (a function that can be fed arguments of the appropriate type) and returns a CleanupTask. A CleanupTask is usually something like an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RBXScriptConnection</code>, and cleaning it means to disconnect it.</p>
<div class="language-lua highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">export</span> <span class="nb">type</span> <span class="n">CleanupTask</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="c1">-- omitted</span>
<span class="n">export</span> <span class="nb">type</span> <span class="n">Stream</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">...&gt;</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">listener</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">...</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="p">())</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">CleanupTask</span>
<span class="c1">-- example: `Stream&lt;number,string&gt;` is the type `(listener: (number, string) -&gt; ()) -&gt; CleanupTask`</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>When a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stream : Stream&lt;number&gt;</code> is called with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">listener</code>, it can call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">listener(x)</code> with any number <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> whenever it likes (synchronously or asynchronously), but it must cancel all future calls once it’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CleanupTask</code> is “cleaned”.
Here is a toy-example to illustrate (we use the terminology “emits <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code>” when the stream calls the listener with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code>).</p>

<div class="language-lua highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">local</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">myStream</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">listener</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">number</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="p">()):</span> <span class="n">CleanupTask</span>

<p>Streams are about control-flow and data-flow. By listening to a stream, i.e. giving it a callback/behaviour, you yield control to the stream to decide when and with-what-data that behaviour is executed. In this sense, they can be thought of as a common generalisation of for-loops and events, which both provide data from some source, and execute a behaviour synchronously (for-loops) or asynchronously (events).</p>

<p>But do not be mistaken, they are strictly more powerful than either concept!</p>

<p>The reason is that setting up control-flow (connecting to events/streams), while managing the timely clean up of all connections, can explode in complexity. You will do one of the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Grit your teeth and pollute your code with layers of housekeeping logic</li>
  <li>Half-grit your teeth and implement the correct control flow, but with memory leaks (not disconnecting connections)</li>
  <li>Fail to implement the control flow correctly (slack-jawed?)</li>
</ol>

<p>The first cause of complexity, which we will explore in this post, is the need to connect to a dynamically-defined event (Spoiler: it is solved by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">switchMap</code>!).</p>

<h2 id="dynamically-defined-events">Dynamically defined events</h2>

<p>Suppose the local player’s character-model has a “Damage” attribute which we want to display on the screen.
A first approximation might look like:</p>
<div class="language-lua highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">local</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">updateDamageGui</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">damage</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">number</span><span class="err">?</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1">-- disconnect the connection when done displaying</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>If only it was that simple!
Problems:</p>
<ol>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Players.LocalPlayer.Character</code> might be nil (and will be on startup), and therefore we do not have static access to the “PropertyChanged” event - it is dependent on the character instance, so it is a <em>dynamically defined event</em>.</li>
  <li>The call to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">updateDamageGui</code> has been duplicated, hence the abstraction into a function.
Problem 2 is not so-bad here, but, as we’ll see, can worsen arbitrarily when behaviour is scattered amongst a mess of housekeeping logic.</li>
</ol>

<p>Problem 1 is terrible. Let’s chuck a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:Wait()</code> on it!</p>
<div class="language-lua highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">local</span> <span class="n">character</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Players</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">LocalPlayer</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Character</span> <span class="ow">or</span> <span class="n">Players</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">LocalPlayer</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">CharacterAdded</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">Wait</span><span class="p">()</span>

<p>Oh no, our damage stops updating after our character respawns, because <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Players.LocalPlayer.Character</code> is a different instance now!

<p>🤮
Problems:</p>
<ol>
  <li>This is a mess: our important behaviour is getting harder to locate</li>
  <li>We are polluting our local variables with housekeeping variables, which are obtaining more complex names to distinguish themselves.</li>
  <li>When we are done with this behaviour, we have to disconnect our connections in a specific way (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">attributeConnection</code> if it’s not nil and then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">characterConnection</code>). If the nature of the behaviour changes, we must maintain the cleanup logic accordingly, which likely exists in another location.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s start by separating the behaviour from the housekeeping, and encapsulate the cleanup logic.</p>

<p>🤔
We have separated our housekeeping logic from our behaviour, and encapsulated the cleanup logic.
Hiding/moving complexity is not virtuous in itself, but we will find that we can
decompose <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onDamageAttribute</code> into <em>reusable</em> and <em>composable</em> parts, which clearly express the
intended behaviour.</p>

<p>From here on, we start using stream terminology. We see <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onDamageAttribute</code> has type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Stream&lt;number?&gt; = ((number?) -&gt; ()) -&gt; CleanupTask</code>, so we’ll call it <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">damageStream</code>, and instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">callback</code>, we opt for the term <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">listener</code>.</p>

<p>Here is the full decomposition of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onDamageAttribute</code>, with nothing omitted (except <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clean</code>).</p>

<p>Now we have some simple components here that we can extract into reusable library functions, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">attributeOf</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">propertyOf</code> (a generalisation of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">characterStream</code>). What is the best way to decompose/understand the creation of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">damageStream</code> from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">characterStream</code> via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">damageStreamStream</code>?</p>

<p>The answer is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">switchMap(fn)(characterStream)</code>, where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fn</code> maps characters to damage streams (or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nilOnce</code>). Internally, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">switchMap</code> maps the emitted characters to damage streams, and uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">switchAll</code> to emit from the latest damage stream.</p>

<p>This kind of combination of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">switchMap</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">attributeOf</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">propertyOf</code> is common enough that we provide a shorthand <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">toAttribute(name): (Stream&lt;Instance?&gt;) -&gt; Stream&lt;any?&gt;</code> (resp. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">toProperty</code>) for it, which allows a terse/idiomatic presentation.</p>

<p>Some notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>This definition of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">damageStream</code> evaluates to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">toAttribute("Damage")(propertyOf(Players.LocalPlayer, "Character"))</code>. Piping is just a way to reverse application syntax, so that stream-transformers are sequenced after the stream.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">listen</code> is again just syntax, it just does <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">damageStream(updateDamageGui)</code> - don’t use it if you don’t like it</li>
  <li>Since <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">updateDamageGui</code> is no longer duplicated, we can simply write it’s contents within the listen call, like this:
    <div class="language-lua highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">local</span> <span class="n">cleanup</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">listen</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">damageStream</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">damage</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">number</span><span class="err">?</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>Imagine writing all of the housekeeping logic for this in the first style!</p>

<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>

<p>In reflection: is this good programming?</p>

<p>The real test is whether working with these abstractions in practice is easier in the long run than working with the original mess.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is it flexible and maintainable?</li>
  <li>Is it easy to understand and debug?</li>
  <li>How much overhead does it add - both cognitively and computationally?</li>
</ul>

<p>I have written <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Stream.luau</code> with these things in mind. In particular, streams are just functions, and their internal state is entirely implemented through local variables in their closure. In many cases, it is straightforward to take an abstractly presented stream, such as our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">damageStream</code> example, and repeatedly beta-reduce (for every function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f(x)</code>, and expression <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exp</code>, replace <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f(exp)</code> with the body of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> replaced by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exp</code>) until the code resembles the original barebones implementation (with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">attributeConnection</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">characterConnection</code>). This is basically reversing the process of abstraction that we followed - and this thought process is useful for keeping your feet on the ground about what you are doing.</p>

<p>I deliberately avoid using abstractions like maids, signals, brios inside this library - because the cleanup logic is not that difficult to write manually! We are writing a library to do housekeeping for the user, we do not need housekeeping help ourselves. I have also done this to try make stepping-through-the-code-debugging a less miserable experience - it’s easier if we’re not venturing into the guts of a maid every other line.</p>

<p>This library of functions is not an API. I am not doing any complex optimisations under the hood to make up for abstraction overhead. Instead, I’ve tried to walk the road of non-pessimism and wrote the dead-simplest code I could to implement the behaviour. I recommend just reading all of the code and changing whatever design decisions you disagree with.</p>

<p>From my experience with Rx, I don’t think this goes without saying: don’t use streams as a universal hammer for every problem, and try not to get too big-brained about fancy ways of combining streams together. It is possible to do some very complicated stream-piping karate to construct the perfect stream to feed into a short listener function, where in-fact you could have just moved more code into your listener function for a more readable result, or just split your problem into two streams. Sometimes the most readable stream is one you define from scratch (it’s just a function!) - you don’t need to build every stream out of stream primitives and transformers. Conversely, you <em>should</em> use the library functions when they do some real, non-trivial work for you, like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">switchMap</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">combineLatest</code> (or it’s typed interfaces: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">combine1</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">compute2</code> etc).</p>

<p>We’ve only discussed dynamically defined events, and their solution <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">switchMap</code>.
Next time we’ll talk about managing lifetimes with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">listenTidyEach</code> in the simplest possible way.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is this battle-tested?</p>

<p>Nope. I’ve barely used it yet.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do I install it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just copy it: <a href="https://gist.github.com/blinkybool/1390d53a730493e2ce72549c5bf7eaec">Stream.luau</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What’s the difference between streams and observables, and why did you write this if we already have Rx?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short: streams+listeners are a simplified version of observables+subscribers, where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stream(listener)</code> corresponds to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">observable:Subscribe(onFire)</code>. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:Subscribe(onFire, onFail, onComplete)</code> method constructs a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Subscriber</code> object using the provided functions, and passes it internally to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">observable._onSuscribe(sub)</code>. So a stream is just an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_onSubscribe</code> function, and a listener is just an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onFire</code> function.</p>

<p>This library is a (typed) distillation of the core concepts in <a href="https://quenty.github.io/NevermoreEngine/api/Rx/">Rx</a>, <a href="https://quenty.github.io/NevermoreEngine/api/Brio/">Brio</a> and <a href="https://quenty.github.io/NevermoreEngine/api/Blend/">Blend</a> that I personally have found useful for programming in Roblox, which are: connecting to dynamically defined events, binding creation+cleanup or behaviour to lifetimes, declarative instance creation, and reactive state management.</p>

<p>I concluded that I could achieve all of this without subscribers having an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onFail</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onComplete</code>, which, in Rx, spend most of their time being passed around, while <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onFire</code> is where all the interesting stuff happens. Using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onFail</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onComplete</code> makes observables more comparable to promises, which you may find beneficial.</p>

<p>The removal of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onFail</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onComplete</code> causes many simplifications - there is no need for a subscriber to have state, so it’s essentially just a wrapper around the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onFire</code> callback-function - therefore why not make it just a function? The choice to make the observable/stream object itself a function, rather than a class-object, is less essential but has the following motivations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I originally just wanted to write a typed version of Rx, because my most frequent and annoying bugs are all type errors (usually not handling nil). Typing for OOP classes/objects in Luau is not-so-well supported - there are multiple ways to achieve it, but there are tradeoffs and complications with each. On the other-hand, typing for function inputs/outputs is dead simple and quite reliable.</li>
  <li>In most contexts I don’t like to think of streams as “objects” or “data”. Listening to a stream is closer to using a compiler macro that inserts the listener logic between the housekeeping logic. Why introduce an object for this?</li>
  <li>I would like to claim that not allocating a table for every stream (like observables/maids/brios) is an advantage for streams over observables, but I lack the proper knowledge of luau to back this up (nor have I tested it - yet).</li>
  <li>Step-through-the-code debugging is important to me, not just for fixing bugs but understanding what my code is actually doing (how much non-essential busywork is it doing?). So reducing non-fundamental operations like entering an object constructor or entering a class method just to call the real-function stored in the object, makes a big difference to that experience.</li>
</ul>

<p>A compromise, that you may not like to give up, is that streams are less inspectable at runtime - the best you can do is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">typeof(thing) == "function"</code>, and it’s not possible to distinguish a stream from any other function. You may have a programming style that necessitates object inspection like this, in which case you could go ahead and refactor everything to use a constructor like this.</p>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<p>These are some thoughts I had about the design of “replay” which is a module for recording and replaying a talk given in Roblox. When you replay a talk, a clone of the original character appears and delivers the talk to you, moving just how they originally did, and writing on the board live, just as they originally did. It’s basically magic - especially when the talk is given in VR. Check it out!</p>

<h2 id="replay-design">Replay Design</h2>

<p>I had a pretty good conceptual model of how the replay would work, and how I would synchronise all of the board writing with the character positions. Every element of the scene to be recorded (at this point just characters writing on a board) can be captured at at many different levels. For example, to replay a character moving around, I could capture the positions of the parts every single frame, or I could capture the user inputs that caused the character to move around as it did during recording. For board writing, I could capture the entire state of the board every single time it changed, or I could capture the arguments of the client-to-server events that cause each change to the board. Going even further, I could capture the user inputs on the client (where their pen was) which caused those remote events to fire.</p>

<p>Taking it to the extreme I could try to record the neurons firing in the brain of the person controlling the character, and then try to fire those same neurons to make them replay their inputs. At the other extreme of this spectrum is something like doing a plain old screen recording of the rendered scene on your computer (or even further, the neurons that fire when you watch the recording happen).</p>

<p>My point is that there’s a flow of information, from intent, to input, to code-execution/remote-events, to appearance/influence in the workspace, to your screen/speakers, to your eyes and ears. The task of recording and can be viewed as picking the right moment to intercept that flow of information, and then replaying is a matter of re-entering that flow of information.</p>

<p>There are pros and cons to choosing different points of the flow. For example, if I record a CFrame for all 16 parts of the character 30 times a second, that’s 480 CFrames/sec, or 5,760 numbers/sec, or 46KB/second, or 2.76MB per minute. This is much more data than would be required to store just the user inputs. A similar comparison holds for storing the whole board state every time it changes vs storing the remote event calls.</p>

<p>In general it seems that there is more data to store later in the flow, so earlier must be better yeah? Not exactly. There are important drawbacks recording earlier points in the flow. The system being recorded does not exist in isolation of the workspace around it. The positions of the parts of a character are not just a function of the player inputs, since it can be influenced by things like physics simulation (you might be assaulted by the audience while lecturing). If those physical influences don’t also occur to the character while replaying, the character might end up a metre to the left of where they should be writing. Even without external influences, you are relying on determinism of the physics engine if you are re-simulating everything live.</p>

<p>The same point is relevant for the writing on the board. If you are re-performing the individual writing events, then the actions of the users watching can destroy or obscure what you were writing. On the other hand if there is someone else present during the recording whose board interaction isn’t being recorded, then you could end up with a very different outcome during the replay. For example, they could clear the board during the recording (perhaps they were trying to help!), but this won’t occur in the replay.</p>

<p>The best way forward is to attempt to strike a balance where you can record data efficiently, while being resistant to the chaos of re-simulation. A good example of this is how I ended up recording VR characters. We use the Nexus VR Character Model, which translates the user input cframes of the controllers and headset into 3 world-relative CFrames, then passes those to all other clients. Those 3 CFrames are then used to position (with physics) all 16 parts of the character using Motors. I record these CFrames as they come into the server, and on replay I just call the same functions that perform the physics simulation to position the character parts. Subsequent physics that occur during the replay can affect the character parts, but they cannot affect the recorded CFrames, so if the character is pushed during the replay, it will be dragged back towards the target CFrames anyway. This is what I mean by making the replay resistant to the chaos of re-simulation.</p>

<p>I haven’t quite achieved the same balance for recording the board writing, and this is partly because we don’t necessarily want the person in the replay to be the only who can interact with the board. It could be quite useful to be able to annotate and edit freely on the fly. It’s also just kinda fun (funny) to mess with the recording. Erasing what it writes, jumping on its head etc. The later in the flow of information that the recording derives-from, the less novel the whole thing becomes. Just seeing the end of that flow is just like watching a screen recording. As an audience member, the more you can influence the re-simulation of things the more involved and connected you feel to whats happening in front of you.</p>

<p>However, it’s no fun to accidentally ruin the re-simulation of a replay that you’re trying to learn from, and the speaker starts gesturing at things that aren’t there anymore (either because they’ve been moved, or what they’ve written has been erased). I think a good compromise is to allow some degree of re-simulation, but let the audience choose to jump back to the canonical state of things, i.e. putting the character back where they should be, and making the board look as it was at that point in the recording. This happens automatically for the character, but the board might be a little trickier.</p>

<h2 id="technical-roadblocks-and-debugging">Technical Roadblocks and Debugging</h2>

<p>I want to end with some reflections on the technical side of things. The first issue I faced was how to patch into metaboard in a natural way to record and replay the writing events. I wanted to make “replay” an independent module that interfaces with metaboard, as opposed to just baking replays as a special use case into the metaboard code. This amounted to a refactor that separated the remote event handling from the board-state-manipulation. In the future I can imagine having to refactor more functions to take additional arguments, or inserting intermmediate functions that can be used by external modules.</p>

<p>It also took a while to get the character simulation working, which most involved learning how the Nexus VR Character Model works. I got it working with a hack that doesn’t animate as smoothly as it should but I’ll revisit this later.</p>

<p>The thing that took by far the longest, and was the most soul-draining, was debugging would-be-type errors. After writing all the datastore code to serialise, store, restore and desererialise a replay, the code had grown a bit and there was a lot of arguments being passed around. I spent many boring hours hitting play, putting the headset on, testing until there was an error, taking it off, then trying to locate which function had been called with the wrong argument order, or was missing arguments. This was made worse by the fact that in some circumstances, the use of coroutines can prevent errors from surfacing to the output as they normally would. They would only appear if I run the program in debug mode and carefully step through it. I don’t fully understand yet why this happens.</p>

<p>The problems with passing incorrect arguments around usually occurs when I modify a function to take more or less arguments, and then forget to update all instances that make use of that function. One remedy that I have begun to employ is passing a single table of named arguments to the function, which means order never matters.  However this isn’t a complete solution. When mistakes inevitably happen, the error usually occurs deep into a stacktrace of function calls, and the game is to figure out which function was called with incorrect arguments, which can be much further up, and sometimes in a past thread.</p>

<p>These problems don’t occur in a strictly-typed programming language, and this is certainly the reason why many Roblox programmers have been attracted to writing their games/libraries with TypeScript. You write the code (mistakes and all), and the type checker catches all the silly type errors for you. And it captures them where they first happen, not just where they cause a problem later down the road, and not just the ones that your runtime scenario runs into.</p>

<p>At this time I have no desire to invest any time programming in TypeScript for Roblox, but it’s starting to feel a bit amateur-hour to be debugging type errors the way I am. I’m considering trying out “t” which is a runtime typechecker.</p>

<p><a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/t-a-runtime-type-checker-for-roblox/139769">https://devforum.roblox.com/t/t-a-runtime-type-checker-for-roblox/139769</a></p>

<p>It only works at runtime, but the difference it would make is that there is no longer a game of finding where in the stack of function calls was an argument passed incorrectly.</p>

<p>I’ve tried using the luau type checker, but I’ve never actually seen it alert me to a type error so I doubt I was using it properly. Also I don’t think it works if a function is imported from somewhere in the datamodel that only exists at runtime.</p>
